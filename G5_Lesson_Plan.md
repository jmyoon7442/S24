## Detailed Activity Plan

### 01. Preview

**Activity:**
- Watch a 1.5-minute video related to the story.
- Pose a key question at the end of the video to engage students.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Class 5, before we start, we will watch a short video related to today’s class. There will be a question at the end, so please watch the video carefully.
- (Play the video)
- Teacher: So, what was the last question?
- Student: The video asked what was written on the parchment!
- Teacher: That's right. Shall we guess and share your thoughts?
- Student: It might be written about something eligible to take the treasure.
- Teacher: That’s a good idea! Then, let’s check after the class to see if your answers are correct!

### 02. Learning the Story

**Activity:**
- Use the Read-Aloud Practice App.
- Play audio files of sentences for students to repeat and practice pronunciation.

**Script:**
- Teacher: This sentence contains a relative pronoun. Listen carefully and repeat together! (Play the audio file)
- Student: (Repeats) “It read: To those who seek adventure, true treasure lies not in gold but in the journey and the friendships forged along the way.”

### 03. Grammar Teaching

**Activity:**
- Use slide images to explain relative pronouns.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Please focus on the screen. Today, we are going to learn about relative pronouns. A relative pronoun is a word that is used to connect an independent clause to a relative clause. It acts as a glue, combining two sentences into one. Do you all understand?
- Student: I understand.
- Teacher: Good. In these two sentences, 'who' and 'which' are relative pronouns.

### 04-1. Personal Activity for Grammar Learning

**Activity:**
- Use the Sentence Combiner App to create sentences with relative pronouns.
- Share sentences on Padlet.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Everyone, scan the QR code on the screen to access Padlet. You can find the post titled "Personal Activity." Our first activity is to make sentences using relative pronouns. When you type two sentences about one person, a combined sentence will be made. Don’t forget to use the pronoun in the subject position of the second sentence. I’ll give you 3 minutes. Make one sentence and upload it on the Padlet. If you have any questions, please raise your hand.

### 04-2. Group Activity for Story Comprehension

**Activity:**
- Use the Multiple Question App to test story comprehension.
- Upload results to Padlet.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Look for the Group Activity post. Click on the link for a quiz to test your understanding of the story. Solve the questions with your group members, capture your score, and upload it to Padlet. You have 5 minutes. Start your activity!

### 05. Feedback on Group Activity

**Activity:**
- Review the group activity results and provide feedback.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Times up! Please upload your screen image to the Padlet. Let's take a look. It seems everyone did well on questions 2 and 3, but many got question 1 wrong. Shall we review this question together?

### 06. Review through Word Cloud App

**Activity:**
- Use a word cloud to review key points of the lesson.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Let's recall what we’ve learned about the story today. What words do you see?
- Student: I can see the word ‘parchment’!
- Teacher: Can you tell me about the word 'parchment'?
- Student: In the parchment, there is a lesson that the real treasure lies in the journey and the friendship forged on the way!
- Teacher: Yes, that's right. You all learned well!

### 07. Giving Assignment

**Activity:**
- Assign homework using the Cloze Question App.
- Students rearrange fragments to form complete sentences with relative pronouns.

**Script:**
- Teacher: Now, let’s give you an assignment! You can find the post about the assignment. The task is to rearrange fragments to make a complete sentence involving relative pronouns. Read the instructions carefully, and upload your screen image to Padlet. Complete your assignment by the next class on June 12th. See you next class!
